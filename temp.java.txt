A book intends to design a program to display the denomination of an input amount, upto 5 digits. The availabel denomination with the bank are of rupees 2000, 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1

Design a program to accept the amount from the user and display the break-up in descending order of denomination. (i.e. preference should be given to the highest denomination avaible) along with the total number of notes. [Note: Only the denomination used should be displayed]. Also print the amount in words according to the digits.

Example 1

INPUT : 14856
OUTPUT: ONE FOUR EIGHT SEVEN SIX

DENOMINATION : 2000 * 7 = 14000
                500 * 1 =   500
                100 * 3 =   300
                 50 * 1 =    50
                  5 * 1 =     5
                  1 * 1 =     1

              Total: 14856
  Total Number of notes = 21
